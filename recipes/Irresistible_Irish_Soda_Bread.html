    <h4>This traditional Irish soda bread recipe is very easy and makes a great-tasting soda bread. Best if made the day before, or several hours before serving.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar
            <li>1 teaspoon salt
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda
                    <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten
                        <li>2 cups buttermilk
                            <li>¼ cup butter, melted
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Blend egg and buttermilk together; add all at once to the flour mixture and mix just until moistened. Stir in butter. Pour into prepared pan.
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 65 to 70 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the bread should come out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
